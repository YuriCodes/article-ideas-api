Article Ideas API

Hello everyone! If you're like me the hardest part about writing is coming up with new content ideas, this drove me to create my very own Article Ideas/Inspiration API. It gives you a prompt based on the Language you select. This was made with the https://github.com/typicode/json-serverâ€‹ package. 

You can check it out here: https://article-api-inspiration.herokuapp.com/articles

I encourage you that if you have any ideas for articles to help me expand my database and make a pull request!!
